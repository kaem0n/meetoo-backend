# MeeToo

MeeToo is a social media platform that I created as my final project for my coding bootcamp. It features all the basic functionalities of any modern social media platform.

In this repository you can find the backend side of the project. It is based on Java, and it uses Spring as framework. Check pom.xml file for a complete list of dependencies I used.

You can find the frontend code [here](https://github.com/kaem0n/meetoo).
